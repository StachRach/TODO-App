# TODO-App

A single page application. It:

- allows to add new position to the active list by a form (name, date, importance),
- shows active tasks, but completed as well,
- allows to delete any position from both lists.

Alas, after refreshing, tasks return to the default ones.

## To do:

- Update from class components to React Hooks
- Add .json file, which will contain every tasks (remembering tasks between sessions)
